# Maze_escape_game
Overview:

This is a simple maze game created using Python and Pygame. The objective is to navigate a red ball through a maze to reach the exit while avoiding being caught by a green chaser ball.

Features:

Maze Generation: The maze is generated using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

Player Control: Move the red ball using the arrow keys.

Chaser Ball: A green ball chases the red ball using breadth-first search (BFS) pathfinding.

Timer: The game resets every 90 seconds.

Collision Detection: The game ends if the red ball touches the maze walls or is caught by the green ball.
